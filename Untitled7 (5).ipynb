        "\"\"\"\n",
        "Statistics is a branch of mathematics that involves collecting, analyzing, interpreting, and presenting data. It deals with methods for gathering, organizing, summarizing, and analyzing data to extract meaningful information and draw conclusions.\n",
        "\"\"\"\n",
        "\n",
        "# Q2. Define the different types of statistics and give an example of when each type might be used.\n",
        "\"\"\"\n",
        "- Descriptive Statistics: Descriptive statistics are used to summarize and describe the main features of a dataset. Examples include measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode) and measures of variability (standard deviation, range).\n",
        "\n",
        "- Inferential Statistics: Inferential statistics involve making predictions or inferences about a population based on a sample of data. Examples include hypothesis testing and confidence intervals.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "Descriptive statistics can be used to summarize the grades of students in a class, while inferential statistics can be used to determine if there is a significant difference in the performance of students between two different teaching methods.\n",
        "\"\"\"\n",

        "# Q3. What are the different types of data and how do they differ from each other? Provide an example of each type of data.\n",
        "\"\"\"\n",
        "- Qualitative Data: Qualitative data are categorical or non-numeric data that represent qualities or characteristics. Examples include gender, color, and marital status.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Quantitative Data: Quantitative data are numerical data that represent quantities or amounts. Examples include height, weight, and income.\n",

        "Levels of measurement refer to the different ways in which data can be measured or classified. There are four levels of measurement: nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Nominal: Nominal data are categorical data with no inherent order or ranking. Example: Eye color (Blue, Brown, Green).\n",
        "- Ordinal: Ordinal data are categorical data with a specific order or ranking. Example: Education level (High School, Bachelor's, Master's, PhD).\n",
        "- Interval: Interval data are numeric data with a fixed unit of measurement and no true zero point. Example: Temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit.\n",
        "- Ratio: Ratio data are numeric data with a fixed unit of measurement and a true zero point. Example: Height, Weight.\n",

        "\n",
        "# Q6. Why is it important to understand the level of measurement when analyzing data? Provide an example to illustrate your answer.\n",
        "\"\"\"\n",
        "Understanding the level of measurement is important because it determines the type of statistical analysis that can be performed on the data. Different levels of measurement require different statistical techniques.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, using arithmetic operations such as addition and subtraction on nominal data (e.g., categories like male and female) would not make sense, whereas it would be appropriate for ratio data (e.g., height and weight).\n",

        "Nominal data are categorical data with no inherent order or ranking, while ordinal data are categorical data with a specific order or ranking. In nominal data, categories are simply labels or names with no quantitative significance, whereas in ordinal data, categories have a meaningful order or rank.\n",

        "A box plot (or box-and-whisker plot) is commonly used to display data in terms of range. It provides a visual representation of the distribution of a dataset, including the median, quartiles, and outliers.\n",

        "Descriptive statistics are used to summarize and describe the main features of a dataset, such as measures of central tendency and variability. They provide insights into the characteristics of the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Inferential statistics, on the other hand, involve making predictions or inferences about a population based on a sample of data. They allow researchers to draw conclusions and make generalizations about the population from which the sample was drawn.\n",
